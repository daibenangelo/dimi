DMMMSU Hymn

Hail beloved Alma Mater
Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University
Your honored name will shine forever
Keep your glorious fame resounding far and near.
From thy portals, we learn skills unknown before
In hearts and hands keep on craving for more

Oh hail beloved institution
Never shall we stand forlorn
From you, a new era is born
To keep life smoothly moving on.

You are our inspiration
In our quest for knowledge and wisdom
You fulfill a noble mission
In instruction, research and extension
You give the best solution
In transforming our land into a great nation
And though the years may come and go
Our love for you will glow
Beloved University
We are proud of you.
We are proud of you.
