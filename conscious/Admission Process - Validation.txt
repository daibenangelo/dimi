ADMISSION PROCESS - VALIDATION

Sec. 1 Only courses aligned with DMMMSU's offerings qualify for validation:
Courses from non-deregulated HEIs and CHED-supervised institutions with grades of "2.50" or lower require validation, while those from deregulated HEIs and SUCs are automatically credited.
Validation must occur within the first three terms of admission and before the course is offered.
DOUS: Credits for courses, training, and seminars require Committee evaluation.
Undergraduate: Course credits are based on Committee evaluation following institutional validation policies.

Sec. 2 A validation fee applies.

Sec. 3 Validation is administered and checked by the Instructor assigned by the Department Chairperson/Director.

Sec. 4 Validation results ("Sustained" or "Failed") must be submitted within the term.

Sec. 5 Degree holders from other State Colleges/Universities may receive credit for up to 50% of required units, as determined by the Department Chairperson/Director, without validation.
