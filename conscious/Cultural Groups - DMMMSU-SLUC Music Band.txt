The DMMMSU-SLUC Music Band aims to perform high-quality musical works, reach communities through concerts and mentorship, and make a lasting impact through music. Membership is open to anyone interested in music, including students, staff, alumni, and others aligned with its goals. There are three membership tiers: active members (two semesters or more in the band), new members (recently joined), and imports (invited for outstanding performances), each with specific criteria.
